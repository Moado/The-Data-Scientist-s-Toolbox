Ce r√©pertoire sera mis √† jour chaque semaine avec de nouvelles ressources.  Profitez de l'apprentissage de la science des donn√©es et faites passer le mot ! 


Take 5 seconds to discover the resources I've gathered and structured to myself over the past 5 years.  

Today, I give you access to my private library which contains academic and professional resources for Data Science.  

If you love data, this is your lucky day since you'll love it even more with 500 TB of documents and various training courses.   

For the students following a Master in Data Science, they will find a large bank of theoretical and applied Master theses in a variety of topics such as the Financial, Medical, Logistics, Oceanography, Environmental, and Security fields in both French and English from 2000 to 2019.   

Courses from the best universities in the world such as Stanford, MIT, and Berkeley, to name but a few, as well as summaries of all current technologies, are well organized to meet your immediate knowledge needs.   

If you intend to apply data science to the field of finance, you should know that there is a complete MBA documentation covering (finance, management, economics, risk and portfolio management, marketing, leadership ...) and for the more experienced data scientists, there is a complete set of more than 300 TB IT training courses.  

In brief, it contains a little bit of everything but more of what you'll need to become a successful data scientist.
